> ### **Local control. Zero latency. No subscription. Native Home Assistant.**

**Firewalla Local** is a high-performance, privacy-first Home Assistant integration designed for users who want to bridge the gap between their network security and their home automation—without the cloud middleman.

## 💡 **Why this exists**
I bought my Firewalla Gold a few years ago for the same reason many of you did: the promise of a powerful, prosumer, DIY-friendly firewall. To be fair, I actually really like the Firewalla app—it does an incredible job of making complex networking accessible.

However, relying solely on it means the ecosystem is not only "Cloud-Locked," but also "App-Locked." Opening an app on your phone is perfectly fine for configuring a VLAN or tweaking a setting every few months. But it becomes a significant handicap when you want to dynamically orchestrate day-to-day routines or leverage rich network data alongside the rest of your homelab services.

After years of maintaining custom SSH scripts to pull system metrics and wiring up clunky workarounds, I eventually reached a fork in the road: either reflash my hardware to a fully open-source OS, or finally build the native Home Assistant integration the community has been asking for.

**I chose to build.**

This integration is for the users who don't want another cloud dependency just to automate a "Kids' Bedtime" rule. It’s for the homelabbers who want network insights displayed right next to their server stats. It's for anyone who wants dynamic, condition-based control over their firewall, and for those who fundamentally believe that what happens on your LAN should stay on your LAN.

> *"I love the Firewalla hardware—it's some of the best on the market. I built this so I wouldn't have to choose between great hardware and a local-first DIY experience."*

## 🏆 **The "Platinum" Approach**
This isn't just a wrapper for a few scripts. It was built from the ground up to meet Home Assistant’s "Platinum" quality standards:
*   **100% Local Data Plane:** After a one-time cloud-brokered pairing (matching the official app's security), all communication is direct to your box on your local network.
*   **Optimistic UI:** When you toggle a rule, Home Assistant updates immediately. No waiting for the next poll cycle to see if your command worked.
*   **UID-First Identity:** Your entities and devices are anchored to your hardware license. They stay stable even if your IP changes or you have to re-pair the device.
*   **Manager-Based Architecture:** Thin, efficient, and typed. Designed for stability and low CPU impact on your Home Assistant instance.

## ✨ **What it Enables**
Firewalla Local has evolved beyond simple monitoring into a comprehensive **local operator toolkit**.

### **Dynamic Network Control**
* **Rule-Backed Switches & Timed Pauses:** Toggle your most-used rules (Internet Block, Social, Gaming) instantly. Use the `pause_rule` and `resume_rule` services to grant duration-based access (e.g., "Give the kids 30 more minutes of gaming") via any HA automation or voice assistant.
* **Host Operator Actions:** Act as the network admin directly from Home Assistant. Wake devices (WOL), rename hosts, set/clear DHCP reservations, and toggle "notify when online/offline" settings seamlessly via actions (services).
* **Guarded Admin API:** Discover and manage the confirmed local catalog for device/group policies, rule CRUD, WAN/VLAN/LAN/Wi-Fi configuration, network interfaces, VPN clients, virtual WAN groups, DNS, data plans, categories, and exceptions. Shell, credential, migration, power, and firmware commands are excluded. Writes default to dry run, require confirmation, redact sensitive responses, and add hash plus impact gates for network changes. `networkConfig` callers send only a merge patch, so omitted secrets stay intact. Any MCP server that can list and call Home Assistant actions can use the same surface; this project does not bundle a separate MCP server. See the [admin contract](docs/ADMIN_CONTROL.md).

### **Presence & Usage Tracking**
* **Router-Based Device Trackers:** Expose highly reliable Home Assistant `device_tracker` entities for your MAC-backed LAN clients for rock-solid "Home/Away" presence automations.
* **Watched-User Monitoring:** Select household members to track their daily total internet usage, unique-usage, associated devices, and positive-only per-app usage based on real-time host joins.
* **Watched-Device Monitoring:** Expose critical endpoints as connectivity sensors with stable activity attributes to ensure your vital hardware stays online.

### **Appliance & Data Visibility**
* **Appliance Monitoring:** Track Firewalla system status, WAN IP details, uptime, memory/disk usage, per-port link/speed/MAC, Bluetooth MAC, box time zone, and the latest successful Speed Test natively. Includes a diagnostic `Sync runtime` button to force an immediate local data refresh.
* **Internet Quality Monitoring:** Expose per-WAN ping latency and packet-loss sensors from the box's continuous Internet Quality monitor (15-minute samples), plus a `get_internet_quality_report` service for the recent history.
* **Per-Network Entities:** Expose every Firewalla network (LAN, VLAN, VPN, WAN) as a native binary sensor carrying kind, VLAN ID, ports, IPv4/IPv6 + DHCP, device count, advanced options (mDNS/SSDP Relay, Block ICMP), and usage — including current-month WAN usage.
* **Per-SSID Wireless Entities (AP7):** When Firewalla AP7 access points are present, expose every wireless network (SSID) as a native binary sensor (status + band, encryption, WPA3, VLAN, interface) and a toggle switch to pause/resume it — all under the Firewalla box device.
* **Per-AP Device Monitoring (AP7):** Each Firewalla AP7 access point becomes its own Home Assistant device (linked to the box), with a system-status binary sensor exposing channel, LED, TX power, country, mesh mode, timezone, pause-WiFi/ACL state, and live client count.
* **Rich Local Reporting:** Leverage over a dozen native Home Assistant services to query host identity records, per-network segment configuration + usage, time usage history, WAN data, and WAN event timelines—all pulled directly from the local data plane without touching the cloud.

## **Supported Hardware & Prerequisites**
* **Firewalla Hardware:** Developed and actively tested on Firewalla Gold. Confirmed working on the following models running the Firewalla Box software that supports the local API:
   * Gold
   * Gold Plus
   * Gold SE
   * Purple
* **Home Assistant:** Requires Home Assistant Core version 2026.3.0 or newer.
* **Network:** Your Home Assistant instance must be able to reach the Firewalla's local LAN IP.

## 🛡️ **A Note on Security & Privacy**
Connecting any external system to your firewall’s management layer requires a high degree of trust.
*   **Independence:** This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Firewalla Inc.
*   **Zero-Credential Storage:** This integration does not store your Firewalla account password. It uses an encrypted token exchange identical to the official Firewalla app.
*   **Local credential persistence:** Testing indicates Firewalla may return a stable local credential bundle for the box during Additional Pairing. Removing the paired-device entry in the Firewalla app should not be treated as a guaranteed revocation of already-cached local access.
*   **Responsibility:** Access to your firewall's control plane is powerful. By bridging your firewall to Home Assistant, you are inherently expanding your network's attack surface. If your Home Assistant instance is exposed or compromised, your network routing and firewall rules could be manipulated. By using this integration, you accept this risk and are solely responsible for locking down your Home Assistant environment (e.g., enforcing 2FA, securing remote access, and managing user permissions).

## 🧭 **Design Philosophy & Scope**
**Firewalla Local** is built for the individual home user. My goal is to provide simple, responsive, and private control over your own local network.

*   **The Goal:** Enabling the "Common Person" to have the same level of local visibility and automation found in many other prosumer networking products.
*   **What this is NOT:** This integration is **not** a Managed Service Provider (MSP) tool. It does not provide multi-site management, fleet-wide reporting, or enterprise-grade monitoring.
*   **Respecting the Ecosystem:** Firewalla offers a robust MSP platform for professionals who need centralized cloud management. This integration does not aim to replicate or provide those services. It is strictly for local-to-local home automation—things like pausing the internet for your kids or checking your router’s CPU load from a dashboard.
